# What is Varnish?

Varnish is an HTTP accelerator designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites as well as APIs. In contrast to other web accelerators, such as Squid, which began life as a client-side cache, or Apache and nginx, which are primarily origin servers, Varnish was designed as an HTTP accelerator. Varnish is focused exclusively on HTTP, unlike other proxy servers that often support FTP, SMTP and other network protocols.

# How to use this image.

## Basic usage

Create a `default.vcl` file:

```vcl
vcl 4.0;

backend default {
  .host = "www.nytimes.com";
  .port = "80";
}
```

Then run:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish -v /path/to/default.vcl:/usr/local/etc/varnish/default.vcl:ro --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d cooptilleuls/varnish
```

Alternatively, a simple `Dockerfile` can be used to generate a new image that includes the necessary `default.vcl` (which is a much cleaner solution than the bind mount above):

```dockerfile
FROM cooptilleuls/varnish:6.0

COPY default.vcl /usr/local/etc/varnish/
```

Place this file in the same directory as your `default.vcl`, run `docker build -t my-varnish .`, then start your container:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d my-varnish
```

### Exposing the port

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d -p 8080:80 my-varnish
```

Then you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.

## Advanced configuration using environment variables

You can override the size of the cache:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish -e "VARNISH_MEMORY=1G" --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d my-varnish
```

You can pass additional parameters to the `varnishd` process:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish -e "VARNISH_DAEMON_OPTS=-t 3600 -p http_req_hdr_len=16384 -p http_resp_hdr_len=16384" --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d my-varnish
```

You can change the path of the VCL configuration file:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish -e "VARNISH_VCL=/root/custom.vcl" -v /path/to/custom.vcl:/root/custom.vcl:ro --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d my-varnish
```

You can also change the ports used in a `Dockerfile`.

```
FROM cooptilleuls/varnish:6.0

ENV VARNISH_LISTEN :8080
ENV VARNISH_DAEMON_OPTS "additional varnish options here"
EXPOSE 8080
```

Or with a command:

```console
$ docker run --name my-running-varnish -e "VARNISH_LISTEN=:8080" --tmpfs /usr/local/var/varnish:exec -d -p 8080:8080 my-varnish
```

# How to install VMODs (Varnish Modules)

[VMODs](https://varnish-cache.org/vmods/) are extensions written for Varnish Cache.

Install VMODs in your Varnish project's `Dockerfile`. For example, to install the [vmod-querystring](https://github.com/Dridi/libvmod-querystring) module:

```dockerfile
FROM cooptilleuls/varnish:6.0

# install vmod-querystring
ENV VMOD_QUERYSTRING_VERSION 1.0.5
RUN set -eux; \
	\
	fetchDeps=' \
		ca-certificates \
		wget \
	'; \
	buildDeps=" \
		$VMOD_BUILD_DEPS \
		dpkg-dev \
	"; \
	apt-get update; \
	apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends $fetchDeps $buildDeps; \
	rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*; \
	\
	wget -O vmod-querystring.tar.gz "https://github.com/Dridi/libvmod-querystring/releases/download/v$VMOD_QUERYSTRING_VERSION/vmod-querystring-$VMOD_QUERYSTRING_VERSION.tar.gz"; \
	mkdir -p /usr/local/src/vmod-querystring; \
	tar -zxf vmod-querystring.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src/vmod-querystring --strip-components=1; \
	rm vmod-querystring.tar.gz; \
	\
	cd /usr/local/src/vmod-querystring; \
	gnuArch="$(dpkg-architecture --query DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE)"; \
	./configure \
		--build="$gnuArch" \
	; \
	make -j "$(nproc)"; \
	make install; \
	\
	cd /; \
	rm -rf /usr/local/src/vmod-querystring; \
	\
	apt-get purge -y --auto-remove -o APT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant=false $fetchDeps $buildDeps
```

# Image Variants

The `varnish` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `varnish:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `varnish:alpine`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).
